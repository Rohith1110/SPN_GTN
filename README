Edge Label Significance: In SPN, edge labels are created by combining the labels of connected nodes (yu * dataset.num_classes + yv). This is based on the assumption that:

Each edge's label uniquely represents the relationship between its connected nodes
Similar node relationships should have similar edge labels
These consistent edge labels help the model learn patterns in graph structure

What This Does:

For the same node relationship (e.g., type-1 node to type-2 node):

Original paper: Always gets the same edge label
Our modification: 80% chance of getting a random label


Learning Impact:

Original: Model can learn "Edge label X always means node type A connects to node type B"
Modified: Model sees:

Same relationship → Different labels 80% of the time
Different relationships → Same labels randomly
Only 20% correct patterns
